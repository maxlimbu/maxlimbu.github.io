<h4>Instructions</h4>
<h5>This is a simple squash game where you get points when you hit the bat everytime after the ball has been retreived. It has similar concept to tennis rebound practise where the aim of the game is to last as long as possible without letting the ball go. Everytime a point is earned the ball will slowly get faster as you get more points.<h5>
